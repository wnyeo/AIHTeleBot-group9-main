# AIHTeleBot

As part of your project, you are required to implement a chatbot using Langchain. However, implementing a whole new web application may be too tedious and out-of-scope, so we have provided code to implement your code to a telegram bot instead!

## What to do: 

### 1. Clone to your repository

On your preferred IDE, open the folder that you wish you put the project in, and proceed to run the following in your shell:

```
git clone https://github.com/zhengfeng-toh/AIHTeleBot
```

And afterwhich,

```
cd AIHTeleBot
```

### 2. Creating the environment variables

On the `aihbot` directory, create a `.env` file or use an existing one (if you have from the lab). Open the file to the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR_OPENAI_APIKEY
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=ls__YOUR_LS_APIKEY
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOTTOKEN
```

Use your group's OpenAI and LangSmith API Key.

We will talk about how to get your Telegram bot token in the next step.

### 3. Get your telegram API key

You will need the API key to connect to a bot. This requires you to navigate to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Do refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmRNjME6mE&ab_channel=SmartBotsLand) should you need help to gather the API key.

After you receive the API key, save it into the `.env` file.

### 4. Install all dependencies

Windows: 
Run the following on your terminal (Command Prompt)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Mac: Run the following on your terminal (zsh)
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. How to make your code run with the bot

There are two Python files that will be running the show, `bot.py` and `model.py`.

- `bot.py` will assist in receiving and sending out responses. 

- `model.py` currently consists of only one function, `getResponses(question)`. It takes in the user's input and should return the message that we would like to return to the user. You are to modify this function with your current model. 

You may use helper functions or even change `bot.py` to suit your project requirements. Ultimately, it is up to your group to decide how the chatbot should behave. 

## 6. Test the bot

Time for you to try your very creation!

Windows: Run the following on your terminal (Command Prompt)
```
python bot.py
```

Mac: Run the following on your terminal (zsh)
```
python3 bot.py
```

If everything works, it should produce the following:
```
Loading configuration...
Successfully loaded! Starting bot...
```

Have fun creating your chatbot!


## Error debugging

My terminal says
```
 File "/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/chromadb/api/types.py", line 99, in maybe_cast_one_to_many
    if isinstance(target[0], (int, float)):
                  ~~~~~~^^^

```

A: Create a folder called docs, add all your relevant documents inside. It should do the trick.
